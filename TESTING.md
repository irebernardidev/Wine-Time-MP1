## Testing User Stories
### Current User Goals:
**As a current user, I want to see regular updates to information, such as prices and wine selection available.**
- The Wine Bar Section highlights the philosophy and offerings of Wine Time, including a brief description, a wine menu, and appetizers. It provides an overview of what visitors can expect when they visit the wine bar.

- Wine Menu and Appetizers Buttons are direct links to the PDF files of the respective menus. These buttons provide quick and easy access to the detailed information about the offerings at Wine Time.

- The Menu page has three flip cards showcasing Red Wines, White Wines, and Sparkling Wines with an image and a description on the front, and a list of featured wines with their prices on the back.

**As a current user, I want to easily navigate through the site and access the information I require with ease.**
- The navigation bar is clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
- The hamburger menu is also clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
- The footer menu is easy to use with appropriate icons for easy identification.

**As a current user, I want to easily navigate to content I have previously viewed within a small number of steps.**
- On all site pages there is a navigation bar, or hamburger menu, with links to each required page.

### New User Goals:
**As a new user, I want to easily navigate the entire site intuitively.**
- The navigation bar is clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
- The hamburger menu is also clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
- The footer menu is easy to use with appropriate icons for easy identification.
